# Excel-As-Visualization-Tool
I used Excel  alongside its power tools (Power Query and Pivot Table) to analyze a dataset.

The picture above is a sample of a data imported into an Excel workbook.

After importing the data into Power Query, I ensured that there were no data error i.e no missing columns, rows, or null values. I also changed data types accordingly. Thereafter, I closed and loaded it to Data Model.

With the use of DAX formulas, I calculated the total salary and average salary of each region. This formula will iterate over any filtered set of data in the Pivot Table.

Then I made a dashboard showing a Pivot Table and Chart of the Salaries for each region. There is an added slicer to help filter the particular year of interest.

The dashboard above helps to visualize the trend in salaries for each region over a period (1997 â€“ 2022).
